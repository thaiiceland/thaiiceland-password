This is my private password manager. I am having it here on github just for practising github.
I haven't manage the files for a while, because I haven't have time to do it. 
The program is not perfect, I know but then I did only make it to be my private password manager and I am not going to sell it. It works for me and that's it.....

When I have more time I will try to make it more secure, and maybe then I will think of it as a program for anyone to use... :)
